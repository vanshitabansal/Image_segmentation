# Image_segmentation
Please Read the Task1 and Task2 Latex Document for better understanding of Code and Project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three folders:
1. Threshold Based 
2. Region Based
3. ANN based

For each folder there is a .ipynb file of code which we can simply run using the following steps:

      1. Download the .ipynb file.      
      2. Open Google Colab in your Web Browser and upload this downloaded file.
      3. Now in the left hand side of the google colab notebook go to files and upload the input images here.
      4. Now press Ctrl+F9 or Run All.
  
In case of ANN based Segmentation we just need to run the code as the dataset will be uploaded using the code.
